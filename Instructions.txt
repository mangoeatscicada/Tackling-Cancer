Each image you see will be different and will contain up to three different types of cell core:

1. The white blood cell core is small, pink and round.
2. The tissue cell core is long and elongated.
3. The cancer cell core is bigger than the others and irregular in shape. They will be patchy purple (as in this image) or yellow (shown in later images) or a mixture of both.

It’s the irregular shaped cancer cell cores we are interested in - you can ignore everything else.

All three types of cell are shown in this image. Take a look, can you spot the different types of cell cores?

Let’s take a closer look at a cancer cell core. As you can see, some of these are yellow and some are a patchy purple colour. They are irregular in shape. The red stuff is connective tissue. You can ignore it. We are only interested in cancer cell cores.

The first question you will be asked is if you can see any cancer cell cores in your image. 

If you can’t see any, or if the image is blank, click “none” and we will move you onto the next image.

If you can see some, we will ask you three more questions...

If you spot cancer cell cores we will ask you to:

Give your best guess as to how many you can see in total (whether they are yellow or not), by clicking on one of the options.

Estimate the proportion of yellow (versus purple) cancer cell cores by clicking on one of the options.

Estimate the brightness of the yellow colour by clicking on one of the options.

And that is all it takes to make a classification.
